Conclusions

In this assignment, we compared the performance of three sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Timsort.
We measured the execution time of each algorithm on different datasets to empirically verify their theoretical time complexities.

Our empirical analysis confirms the theoretical complexities of the sorting algorithms.
Timsort, which combines the advantages of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, significantly outperforms the other algorithms, especially on larger datasets.
This explains why Python's built-in sorting functions use Timsort by default.

In conclusion, while understanding how different sorting algorithms work is valuable, using the built-in Timsort function provides the best performance for most practical applications.
